# 📘 Assignment: Hangman Game Challenge

## 🎯 Objective

Build the classic word-guessing game using Python strings, loops, and user input. You'll create a Hangman game where players guess letters to reveal a hidden word before running out of attempts. Through this project, you'll practice string manipulation, loops, conditionals, and random selection.

## 📝 Tasks

### 🛠️ Build the Hangman Game

#### Description

Create a fully functional Hangman game that allows players to guess letters and try to discover the hidden word before exhausting their allowed attempts. The game should provide clear feedback on each guess and track the game state throughout play.

#### Requirements

Your game must:

- Randomly select words from a predefined list
- Accept letter guesses and show current progress in underscore format (e.g., `_ _ _`)
- Track incorrect guesses remaining and display them
- End the game when the word is guessed or attempts are exhausted
- Display appropriate win/lose messages at the end of the game
