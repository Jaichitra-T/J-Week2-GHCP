# Assignment Instructions

This folder contains guidance for creating and organizing new homework assignments within the repository.

- Use the template located at `templates/assignment-template.md` when adding new assignments. 
- Each assignment should have a descriptive `README.md` in its own subdirectory under `assignments/`.
- Include any starter code, data files, or supporting materials alongside the README.

Feel free to update these instructions with more policies as needed.

## Assignment Markdown Structure Guidelines

All assignment markdown files should follow these guidelines:

### 1. Template Usage

- Assignment markdown files must follow the structure in [`templates/assignment-template.md`](../../templates/assignment-template.md).
- The assignment must be created as a `README.md` file
- Do not remove or skip required sections from the template.

### 2. Section Guidance

The section headers should reflect the structure in the template, including the exact icon usage.

- **Title**: Replace `[Assignment Title]` with a short, descriptive name (e.g., `Python Basics`, `Loops and Conditionals`, `Functions and Modules`).
- **Objective**: Write 1-2 sentences summarizing what the student will learn or accomplish. Focus on the main skills or concepts.
- **Tasks**: For each task:
   - Use a specific, action-oriented task name
   - In the Description, clearly state what the student must do.
   - In Requirements, use bullet points to list the expected outcomes or features. Be specific and measurable
   - Provide example input/output in code blocks if helpful.

### 3. Metadata Requirements

- Each assignment must include an `applyTo` field in its metadata to specify which cohorts or groups this assignment applies to.
- Example: `applyTo: ["cohort-1", "cohort-2"]`

Do not include extra sections unless explicitly specified.
